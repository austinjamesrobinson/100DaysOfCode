## Why Am I Doing This?

* I started my coding journal back in May of 2019. I had absolutely no experience with Computer Science beforehand, unless you count the Introduction To Python course I dropped out of in the first week of university. I felt like I was spelunking into a deep, dark cave - except that I've also never spelunked before. Needless to say, it was terrifying. While I'm still scared for my life when it comes to the knowledge I'm expected to learn if I ever want to have a career in this field, I now know the basic concepts and foundations of programming. I have several friends down in Silicon Valley that I can now have conversations with about their jobs, and I actually understand what they're saying. However, I don't want to simply understand what they're talking about - I want to do what they do. I want to design websites and create apps and develop a video game. Or whatever. I want to take the incredibly powerful tools that coding provides us and create a whole world online that makes our physical world maybe a little bit better. I'm not sure what that'll look like, but I'm ready to dive deeper into this cave. And I'm ready to be held accountable for learning every single day for 100 days straight, thanks to this awesome program developed by [@ka11away](https://twitter.com/ka11away) over at [www.100daysofcode.com](https://100daysofcode.com)!

## Want other habits am I changing?

* 100 Days of Design! I've always been fascinated by Graphic Design, and I recently had the opportunity of subscribing to Adobe Creative Cloud for very cheap. I want to learn the basics of Graphic Design through Massive Open Online Courses, Adobe InDesign and Illustrator through Adobe Tutorials, and how to utilize the tools this discipline provides to develop my branding and marketing skills.
* 100 Days of Writing! I've been writing since I was a child. Actually, I have an undergraduate degree in English and I run a small no-fees publishing press. I also dabble in ghostwriting, but that's another story. Therefore, I'm not necessarily looking to develop writing skills, but moreso I'm interested in allowing myself to write freely every day. I have a lot of writing projects I have yet to get around to, so hopefully this will be my chance to knock them out.
* 100 Days of Spanish! I have six years of Spanish education under my belt. SIX. You want to know which language I don't speak? Spanish. Luckily those years have provided me with the foundation I need to pick up the language pretty easily, as I can read it on an elementary level, and I know how to conjugate. But I want to get to a place where I can provide bilingual support in a workplace if needed. 
* 100 Days of Health! Idk, I just wanna, like, do a bunch of push-ups.
