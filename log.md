The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on April 15, 2020.

## Log

### Day 1
For my first day of #100DaysOfCode I am grateful to be on a free Codecademy PRO account. I had 7 days of PRO back in May of 2018 - it was actually my gateway to coding. I put in well over 30 hours of learning in that 7 day period. However, now I have a new PRO account due to the Coronavirus, which lasts until ~June 15th. I have decided to start over in the Web Development track to brush up on my skills. I'm already a couple lessons in, so today I focused on The Box Model (Height/Width, Padding, Border, Margins).

I also coded my new website [iloveaust.in](https://iloveaust.in) in HTML/CSS and deployed it using Zeit.co. The font displayed on the website is my own - it is titled 'Ajr-Regular' and is a copy of my handwriting. However, even though I utilized @font-face and included the .ttf file in a folder and directed to it, it is not loading on any device that isn't my laptop. Therefore, I utilized a backup handwritten font via Google Fonts. I will figure out how to get my font universal.

### Day 2
I reviewed more lessons on Codecademy. I learned the following:
* The Layout and Flow of HTML elements (Box Model)
* Relative Measurements & Media Queries of Responsive Design
* Web Accessibility

### Day 3

* I designed the graphic standards and brand guidelines using Adobe Illustrator and InDesign, which you can find via this [tweet](https://twitter.com/AUSTINROBlNSON/status/125448226386296422).
* I utilized Media Queries and common device breakpoints to make the site responsive. The only devices the site is not designed for yet is mobile.

### Day 7
* I had a problem getting the SVG images to load from the local directory, but got around that by pointing to the SVG code instead of the file.

### Day 22 - 38
* omg okay I have literally no clue how many days it's been since I actually last logged (I think, like, 10). The reason is that I was writing a book with my friend. We wrote it in 7 days and now we're just waiting for it to be published. I'm gonna continue my coding journey by finishing up [www.potholepress.com](https://www.potholepress.com) and release it alongside the beta alongside the book. I'll make sure to include a link to the book too!

### Day 39
* I worked on my publishing press website for the launch of my new book [The Comptroller's Comptroller: How I Became A Comptroller's Comptroller (A True Story)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0999202952/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_1yb0EbRJ5GEQZ?fbclid=IwAR3tTw7OOB_69W6X81BGGpZPGidKabnntAIoYsgK0GUkixIfPaIBOYLFYCk). It's not finished, but it's getting there.

### Day 40

I also sent it over to my friend Tyler Corley and he told me how he would amend it. You can find it [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/gsansp/my_55step_selftaught_cs_curriculum_updated/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).
