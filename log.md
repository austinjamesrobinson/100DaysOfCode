## Log

### Day 1
For my first day of #100DaysOfCode I am grateful to be on a free Codecademy PRO account. I had 7 days of PRO back in May of 2018 - it was actually my gateway to coding. I put in well over 30 hours of learning in that 7 day period. However, now I have a new PRO account due to the Coronavirus, which lasts until ~June 15th. I have decided to start over in the Web Development track to brush up on my skills. I'm already a couple lessons in, so today I focused on The Box Model (Height/Width, Padding, Border, Margins).

I also coded my new website iloveaust.in in HTML/CSS and deployed it using Zeit.co. The font displayed on the website is my own - it is titled 'Ajr-Regular' and is a copy of my handwriting. However, even though I utilized @font-face and included the .ttf file in a folder and directed to it, it is not loading on any device that isn't my laptop. Therefore, I utilized a backup handwritten font via Google Fonts. I will figure out how to get my font universal.

### Day 2

* The Layout and Flow of HTML elements (Box Model)
