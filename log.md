The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on April 15, 2020.

## Log

### Day 1
For my first day of #100DaysOfCode I am grateful to be on a free Codecademy PRO account. I had 7 days of PRO back in May of 2018 - it was actually my gateway to coding. I put in well over 30 hours of learning in that 7 day period. However, now I have a new PRO account due to the Coronavirus, which lasts until ~June 15th. I have decided to start over in the Web Development track to brush up on my skills. I'm already a couple lessons in, so today I focused on The Box Model (Height/Width, Padding, Border, Margins).

I also coded my new website [iloveaust.in](https://iloveaust.in) in HTML/CSS and deployed it using Zeit.co. The font displayed on the website is my own - it is titled 'Ajr-Regular' and is a copy of my handwriting. However, even though I utilized @font-face and included the .ttf file in a folder and directed to it, it is not loading on any device that isn't my laptop. Therefore, I utilized a backup handwritten font via Google Fonts. I will figure out how to get my font universal.

### Day 2
I reviewed more lessons on Codecademy. I learned the following:
* The Layout and Flow of HTML elements (Box Model)

I started working on my professional website using my newfound web development knowledge!

* I designed the graphic standards and brand guidelines using Adobe Illustrator and InDesign, which you can find via this [tweet](https://twitter.com/AUSTINROBlNSON/status/125448226386296422).
* I utilized Media Queries and common device breakpoints to make the site responsive. The only devices the site is not designed for yet is mobile.

### Day 7
* I had a problem getting the SVG images to load from the local directory, but got around that by pointing to the SVG code instead of the file.
